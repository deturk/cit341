# cit341
This repository is dedicated to Cisco IOS configuration written for the CIT 341 Network Design 2 Cisco class taught by Brother Armstrong at BYU-Idaho during the Spring 2017 Semester. 

The course provided the following devices to each student with direct, physical, and remote access:
<ul>
  <li>Cisco 2511 Integrated Services Router - to be used as the Core Layer</li>
  <li>Cisco Catalyst 3560 PoE Switch - to be used as the Distribution Layer</li>
  <li>Cisco Catalyst 3550 Switch - to be used as part of the Access Layer</li>
  <li>Cisco Catalyst 2950 Switch - to be used as part of the Access Layer</li>
</ul>

Students were required to use their autonomy to configure these devices from scratch with requirements to enable security, redundancy, accessibility, and communication with a remote VoIP system.
